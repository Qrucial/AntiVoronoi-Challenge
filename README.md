Have fun playing! :)

1. We will use the Moonbeam alpha testnet, contract address is: 0x9ba385083e4a822CBf51a156f8D543F87b83DC4D
2. Install MetaMask: https://metamask.io/
3. Add Moonbase Alpha to MetaMask
    Moonbase Alpha RPC: https://moonbeam-alpha.api.onfinality.io/public
    Moonbase Alpha Chain ID: 1287
    Block explorer: https://moonbase-blockscout.testnet.moonbeam.network/
4. Open https://remix.ethereum.org/ and use MetaMask web3 injection
5. Load the smart contract for interaction
6. Hack the smart contract through SPoF, take over it.
